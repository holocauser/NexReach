# Stripe Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The app was experiencing errors when creating paid events with Stripe integration. The error message was:
```
ERROR  Error creating Stripe product: [Error: Failed to create Stripe product: ]
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Insufficient Error Logging**: The original error handling only showed `response.statusText` without the actual error details from Stripe's API response.
2. **Local Image URLs**: Event images were being passed as local file paths (`file:///var/mobile/...`) which Stripe cannot access. Stripe requires publicly accessible URLs for product images.
3. **Inconsistent Stripe Keys**: The StripeProvider component was using different default keys than the stripeService.
4. **No Configuration Validation**: There was no way to validate if the Stripe configuration was correct before attempting API calls.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- **File**: `lib/stripeService.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added detailed logging for API requests and responses
  - Capture and log the full error response body from Stripe
  - Include HTTP status codes in error messages
  - Added success logging for debugging

### 2. Image Upload Integration
- **File**: `lib/stripeService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `uploadEventImage()` method to upload local images to Supabase Storage
  - Modified `createProduct()` to accept uploaded image URLs
  - Skip local file paths and use public URLs for Stripe products

### 3. Configuration Validation
- **File**: `lib/stripeService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `validateConfiguration()` method to test Stripe API connectivity
  - Validates both publishable and secret keys
  - Tests API access by calling Stripe's account endpoint

### 4. Consistent Stripe Keys
- **File**: `components/StripeProvider.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to use the same default publishable key as stripeService
  - Ensures consistency across the application

### 5. Improved Event Creation Flow
- **File**: `store/eventStore.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added Stripe configuration validation before creating products
  - Upload local images to Supabase Storage before Stripe product creation
  - Better error handling with graceful fallback when Stripe fails

### 6. Test Integration
- **File**: `utils/testStripeIntegration.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Created comprehensive test script for Stripe integration
  - Tests configuration, product creation, and price creation
  - Useful for debugging and validation

## How It Works Now

1. **Event Creation Process**:
   ```
   User creates paid event → Validate Stripe config → Upload image (if local) → Create Stripe product → Create Stripe price → Save event to database
   ```

2. **Image Handling**:
   - Local images (`file://...`) are uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Public URLs are used for Stripe product images
   - Graceful fallback if image upload fails

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Detailed error messages with HTTP status codes
   - Graceful degradation when Stripe integration fails
   - Events are still saved to database even if Stripe fails

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```typescript
   import { testStripeIntegration } from '@/utils/testStripeIntegration';
   await testStripeIntegration();
   ```

2. **Create a paid event** with an image and check the console logs for detailed information

3. **Verify in Stripe Dashboard** that products and prices are being created successfully

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the logs** when creating paid events to ensure the fix is working
2. **Test with different image types** and sizes
3. **Consider implementing webhook handling** for payment confirmations
4. **Add retry logic** for failed image uploads
5. **Implement cleanup** for unused Stripe products/prices

## Files Modified

- `lib/stripeService.ts` - Enhanced error handling and image upload
- `components/StripeProvider.tsx` - Fixed key consistency
- `store/eventStore.ts` - Improved event creation flow
- `utils/testStripeIntegration.ts` - Added test script (new file)

The Stripe integration should now work properly with detailed error reporting and proper image handling.
