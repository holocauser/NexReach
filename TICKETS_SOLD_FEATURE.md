## 🗄️ Database Requirements

### Required Tables
The feature uses these existing tables:
- `tickets` - Stores ticket information
- `events` - Stores event information  
- `profiles` - Stores user profile information

### Required Policy
You need to run this SQL migration to allow organizers to view tickets for their events:

```sql
-- Migration: Add policy for organizers to view tickets for their events
-- This allows event organizers to see all tickets sold for their events

-- Drop existing policy if it exists
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organizers can view tickets for their events" ON public.tickets;

-- Create policy for organizers to view tickets for their events
CREATE POLICY "Organizers can view tickets for their events"
ON public.tickets FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.events 
    WHERE events.id = tickets.event_id 
    AND events.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### How to Run the Migration
1. **Option 1**: Run the SQL directly in your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Paste and run the SQL above

2. **Option 2**: Use Supabase CLI (if available)
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --file database/organizer_tickets_policy.sql
   ```
