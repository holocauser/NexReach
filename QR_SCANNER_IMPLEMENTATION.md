# QR Scanner Implementation for Ticket Validation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive QR code scanning system for event organizers to validate tickets at their events. The system includes real-time ticket validation, attendee information display, and manual check-in capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core QR Scanner Functionality
- **QR Code Scanning**: Uses `expo-barcode-scanner` for real-time QR code detection
- **Camera Controls**: Flash toggle, camera switching, and permission handling
- **Event Selection**: Organizers can select which event they're scanning for
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant ticket validation with database updates

### ✅ Ticket Validation Logic
- **QR Code Decoding**: Parses JSON data from QR codes containing ticket information
- **Validation Checks**:
  - Ticket exists in database
  - Ticket belongs to organizer's event
  - Ticket hasn't been validated before
  - Ticket status is 'confirmed'
- **Database Updates**: Sets `validated_at` timestamp and `validated_by` organizer ID

### ✅ User Interface
- **Scanner Interface**: Clean camera view with QR code frame overlay
- **Event Selector**: Modal to choose which event to scan for
- **Validation Results**: Clear success/error messages with attendee information
- **Statistics Display**: Real-time stats showing total, checked-in, and pending tickets
- **Manual Check-in**: Alternative method for cases where QR codes don't work

### ✅ Security & Permissions
- **Row-Level Security**: Organizers can only validate tickets for their own events
- **Camera Permissions**: Proper permission handling with user-friendly prompts
- **Database Policies**: Secure access controls for ticket validation

## Database Changes

### New Migration: `migration_add_ticket_validation.sql`

Added two new columns to the `tickets` table:
- `validated_at`: TIMESTAMPTZ - When the ticket was validated
- `validated_by`: UUID - Which organizer validated the ticket

### New RLS Policies
- **Organizers can validate tickets for their events**: UPDATE policy
- **Organizers can view tickets for their events**: SELECT policy

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`database/migration_add_ticket_validation.sql`**
   - Database migration for ticket validation fields
   - RLS policies for organizer access

2. **`lib/ticketValidationService.ts`**
   - Core service for ticket validation logic
   - QR code decoding and validation methods
   - Manual check-in functionality
   - Statistics calculation

3. **`app/organizer/scan-tickets.tsx`**
   - Main QR scanner interface
   - Camera integration with expo-barcode-scanner
   - Event selection and validation results display

### Modified Files
1. **`types/database.ts`**
   - Updated Ticket interface to include `validated_at` and `validated_by` fields

2. **`app/organizer/dashboard-overview.tsx`**
   - Updated "Scan Tickets" button to point to new scanner

## QR Code Format

Tickets generate QR codes with the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "ticketId": "uuid",
  "eventId": "uuid", 
  "eventTitle": "Event Name",
  "ticketType": "General Admission",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Usage Flow

### For Organizers
1. **Access Scanner**: Navigate to Organizer Dashboard → Quick Actions → Scan Tickets
2. **Select Event**: Choose which event to scan tickets for
3. **Scan QR Codes**: Point camera at attendee QR codes
4. **View Results**: See validation status and attendee information
5. **Manual Check-in**: Use email-based check-in as backup

### For Attendees
1. **Purchase Ticket**: Buy ticket through normal flow
2. **Receive QR Code**: QR code generated in ticket details
3. **Present at Event**: Show QR code to organizer for scanning

## Validation Process

1. **QR Code Scan**: Camera detects and decodes QR code
2. **Data Extraction**: Parse ticket ID and event information
3. **Database Lookup**: Fetch ticket details with event information
4. **Validation Checks**:
   - Ticket exists ✓
   - Not already validated ✓
   - Belongs to organizer's event ✓
   - Status is 'confirmed' ✓
5. **Database Update**: Set validation timestamp and organizer ID
6. **Result Display**: Show success/error with attendee details

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- **Invalid QR Code**: Malformed or corrupted QR data
- **Ticket Not Found**: QR code references non-existent ticket
- **Already Validated**: Ticket was previously checked in
- **Wrong Event**: Ticket is for different event than selected
- **Unauthorized**: Organizer doesn't own the event
- **Invalid Status**: Ticket status is not 'confirmed'

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages with emojis for quick recognition
- Detailed attendee information when available
- Retry options for failed scans
- Manual check-in as fallback

## Statistics & Reporting

### Real-time Stats Display
- **Total Tickets**: All confirmed tickets for the event
- **Checked In**: Successfully validated tickets
- **Pending**: Tickets not yet validated

### Integration with Existing Features
- Stats sync with Tickets Sold screen
- Validation data available in organizer reports
- Audit trail of who validated which tickets

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- QR codes contain minimal necessary information
- No sensitive data exposed in QR codes
- Database queries use proper authentication

### Access Control
- RLS policies ensure organizers only access their events
- Validation requires organizer authentication
- Audit trail of all validation actions

### Privacy
- Attendee information only shown to event organizers
- Validation history maintained for reporting
- No personal data stored in QR codes

## Performance Optimizations

### Camera Performance
- Efficient QR code detection with expo-barcode-scanner
- Optimized camera settings for scanning
- Minimal processing overhead

### Database Performance
- Indexed columns for fast ticket lookups
- Efficient validation queries
- Minimal database writes during validation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache event data for offline scanning
2. **Batch Validation**: Scan multiple tickets at once
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed validation reports
4. **Integration**: Connect with external ticketing systems
5. **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for validations

### Additional Features
- **Photo Capture**: Take photos of attendees during check-in
- **Notes**: Add notes to validation records
- **Export**: Export validation data for external systems
- **API Access**: REST API for third-party integrations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Run the database migration:
   ```sql
   -- Execute migration_add_ticket_validation.sql
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-barcode-scanner
   ```

3. Update app permissions in `app.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "plugins": [
         [
           "expo-barcode-scanner",
           {
             "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access camera to scan QR codes."
           }
         ]
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Testing
1. Create test events and tickets
2. Generate QR codes for tickets
3. Test scanner with various scenarios
4. Verify validation statistics update correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Camera not working**: Check permissions and device compatibility
- **QR codes not scanning**: Ensure good lighting and stable camera
- **Validation errors**: Verify database migration completed successfully
- **Permission denied**: Check RLS policies and user authentication

### Debug Steps
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify database connection and permissions
3. Test with known valid QR codes
4. Confirm event selection is working
